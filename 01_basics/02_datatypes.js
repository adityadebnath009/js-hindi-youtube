//JavaScript does NOT work this way. Instead JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language.

//In JavaScript, we don't have to (and in fact, even can't) declare the types of variables upfront. During the course of a program, we can easily change the types of values stored in a variable, and the interpreter won't complaint even for a second.

console.log(null)
console.log(undefined)
//For null, typeof returns 'object'.//official bug
//null: Explicitly set by the programmer to indicate "no value".
//undefined: Indicates that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value, or a function parameter that has not been provided.
